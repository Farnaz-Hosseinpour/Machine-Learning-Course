# Machine-Learning-Course


Here, you will find step by step guides to build machine learning models that produce predictions and recommendations. 

Specifically, you will find how to peform linear regression, logistic regression, K-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, neural networks and Bayesian models.

The course was taught by Pierson on data science and machine learning methods using Python, and is available on LinkedIn Learning.

Note that these codes are not identical to the ones used for the mentioned course. I made my own changes, modified data, added explanations, and so on.
